| * Level Design Guidelines * |
|.~-------------------------~.|

Each level should consist of 5 layers.
Those layers, and what they must include, are, in order:

Instance: Player_and_Rope
	- Contains the o_Player object and the o_rope_start object
	- These must be on top so the player and rope are always drawn above everything else
	
Tileset: Walls
	- Contains the walls of the level made using the ts_lab tileset
	- Make use of the Brushes tab to place walls easily.
	- Make sure wall tops reach the edges of the screen! No empty space!
	
Instance: Wall_Objects
	- Contains the o_Wall objects that make up the level geometry
	! DO NOT PLACE MULTIPLE o_Wall OBJECTS NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER !
		- Instead, stretch a single o_Wall object to take up the entirety of a surface
		- Place multiple o_Wall objects side-by-side causes errors in the rope
	- When placing walls, make sure they are one 16x tile *shorter* from the bottom of
		the wall texture (in the following layer).
		This is so that ropes wrap around the sides of walls and not the bottom,
		and so the player correctly appears to collide with them.
	- Also contains o_Bottomless objects

Instance: Game_Objects
	- Contains the rest of the objects that make the game work
		(including o_Moveable, o_Switch, o_deathPit, etc)
	! MAKE SURE THAT ALL BLOCKS (o_Moveable, o_Pushable) HAVE A WIDTH DIVISIBLE BY 32 !
	- Like walls, make sure that o_Moveable and o_Pushable objects are one 16x tile shorter
		than they should be.

Tileset: Ground
	- Contains the ground tiles of the level made using the ts_lab tileset
	- Make use of the floor_tiling Auto Tile in the Libraries tab for drawing the floor.
	- Make use of the Brushes tab to place the sides of bottomless pits easily.
	- Make use of the Animated water textures in the Libraries tab to place water
